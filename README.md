About: 
This project was developed in conjunction with undergraduate students in Carnegie Mellon's BHCI program and CWRU University Hospitals.

The goal is to create a web app designed for mobile screen sizes that facilitates the process of virtual dermatology visits. 

The application does this through two primary features:
1. A chat feature, that takes care of the patient intake process more seamlessly than the user filling out information on a form (click through, not developed)
2. A photo filter feature, to emphasize red blemishes and make them more easily detectable by providers (developed)
